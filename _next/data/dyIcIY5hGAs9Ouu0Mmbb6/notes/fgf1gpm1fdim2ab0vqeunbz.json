Maintaining a Positive Atmosphere**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Foster a friendly and respectful environment to ensure everyone's positive experience.\n- Exercise assertiveness to uphold order while preserving a relaxed and casual tone.\n- Always start by introducing yourself.\n- Keep the session aligned with the scheduled time without compromising your natural teaching style.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Class Organization**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Pre-plan your session to incorporate ample practice time. Encourage continuous practice even during pauses.\n- Leverage videos for move inspirations, particularly for advanced dancers.\n- Designate names for unnamed moves, serving as easy reference points.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Teaching Progression**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Refrain from overwhelming with details. Prioritize 1-2 key points at a time. Sometimes, letting students experiment aids learning.\n- Personalize advice while rotating among students.\n- Begin with universally known content, creating a familiar foundation.\n- Cater to varying pace: Introduce additional content for quick learners while ensuring slower students aren't left behind.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Time Management**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Encourage continuous practice and allocate dedicated practice intervals.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Adaptability and Flexibility**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Avoid rigid objectives. Instead, have a scalable plan with incrementally challenging milestones.\n- Introduce challenges progressively: Focus on refining techniques over content addition; experiment with tempo variations.\n- Engage in dance sessions with students (leading/following) to offer tailored feedback and assign 1-2 individual tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Addressing Common Challenges**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Adapt explanations when faced with comprehension gaps. Multiple perspectives often help.\n- For struggling individuals or late-comers: Identify their primary challenge, allocate a specific task, and celebrate their progress. Encourage peer teaching.\n- Counterbalance lead/follow discrepancies: Prepare role-specific content, motivate role-reversal, or reallocate volunteers.\n- If someone really wants to be in a different level than they should be: [Needs Solution]\n- There’s nothing that can *significantly* go wrong- roll with it, try your best; you can always openly communicate with the group, tell them it isn’t going to plan, laugh about it\n\n---\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.95.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":false,"templateHierarchy":"template","enableSmartRefs":false},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"assetsPrefix":"/FFA-notes","copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["teaching"],"enableSiteLastModified":true,"siteRootDir":"docs","siteUrl":"https://cemyld.github.io","enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"writeStubs":false,"seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enablePrettyLinks":true,"theme":"dark","enableTaskNotes":true,"templateVersion":"0.97.0","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"teaching","searchMode":"lookup"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
