## General teaching concepts

### Maintain a positive atmosphere

#### Strategies

- Being friendly and respectful is the most important thing—you want everyone to have a good experience.
- Be assertive enough to maintain order and structure, but keep in mind that this is meant to be casual.
- Introduce yourself
- Be relaxed and casual according to your own personality, keep it on time

### Class organization

#### Strategies

- Plan ahead: enough time to practice, encourage them to practice even if they stop
- Watch videos to get ideas for moves– more relevant for advanced dancers
- Give names to moves if they don’t have them, for reference points

### Teaching Progression

#### Strategies

- Don’t overwhelm with explanations- focus on only 1-2 aspects at a time. Just let people try it sometimes– helps people learn, also helps you determine the most common problems, most helpful things to explain
- Customize advice to student as you go around individually
- Establish minimal baseline that everyone knows- start with something everyone knows/can do
- Be fair to people who move slowly– propose new things for faster learners
- Stop them after the familiar material and slowly add on new/complicating elements

### Time management

#### Strategies

- Remind people to keep practicing– build in practice time

### Adaptability and flexibility

#### Strategies

- Don’t establish a firm goal– have a progressive plan with a few points, increasingly more difficult
- This could involve increasing expectations– perfecting technique rather than adding content; practicing at different speeds
- Dance with people whenever possible (as lead/follow as appropriate): give customized feedback, 1-2 personalized assignments

### Knowing how to address common problems
  
- Explain from different angles; your explanation will need to be adapted if people are not getting it;
- If one person is lagging behind and not getting it/ people come in late: Find the first basic thing they are struggling with, give them an individual assignment; positive reinforcement/ celebrate small wins; encourage people to teach each other
- Not enough leads/follows: Have something in your back pocket that is lead or follow specific. Challenge people to switch roles. Shuffle around instructors.
- If someone really wants to be in a different level than they should be: ????
- There’s nothing that can *significantly* go wrong- roll with it, try your best; you can always openly communicate with the group, tell them it isn’t going to plan, laugh about it
