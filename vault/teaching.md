## **General Teaching Concepts**

### **1. Maintaining a Positive Atmosphere**

#### **Key Strategies:**

- Foster a friendly and respectful environment to ensure everyone's positive experience.
- Exercise assertiveness to uphold order while preserving a relaxed and casual tone.
- Always start by introducing yourself.
- Keep the session aligned with the scheduled time without compromising your natural teaching style.

### **2. Class Organization**

#### **Key Strategies:**

- Pre-plan your session to incorporate ample practice time. Encourage continuous practice even during pauses.
- Leverage videos for move inspirations, particularly for advanced dancers.
- Designate names for unnamed moves, serving as easy reference points.

---

### **3. Teaching Progression**

#### **Key Strategies:**

- Refrain from overwhelming with details. Prioritize 1-2 key points at a time. Sometimes, letting students experiment aids learning.
- Personalize advice while rotating among students.
- Begin with universally known content, creating a familiar foundation.
- Cater to varying pace: Introduce additional content for quick learners while ensuring slower students aren't left behind.

---

### **4. Time Management**

#### **Key Strategies:**

- Encourage continuous practice and allocate dedicated practice intervals.

---

### **5. Adaptability and Flexibility**

#### **Key Strategies:**

- Avoid rigid objectives. Instead, have a scalable plan with incrementally challenging milestones.
- Introduce challenges progressively: Focus on refining techniques over content addition; experiment with tempo variations.
- Engage in dance sessions with students (leading/following) to offer tailored feedback and assign 1-2 individual tasks.

### **6. Addressing Common Challenges**

#### **Key Strategies:**

- Adapt explanations when faced with comprehension gaps. Multiple perspectives often help.
- For struggling individuals or late-comers: Identify their primary challenge, allocate a specific task, and celebrate their progress. Encourage peer teaching.
- Counterbalance lead/follow discrepancies: Prepare role-specific content, motivate role-reversal, or reallocate volunteers.
- If someone really wants to be in a different level than they should be: [Needs Solution]
- There’s nothing that can *significantly* go wrong- roll with it, try your best; you can always openly communicate with the group, tell them it isn’t going to plan, laugh about it
