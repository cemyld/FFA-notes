## **Introduction**

This guide aims to provide instructors with a structured approach to introducing newcomers to this captivating dance form. Our goal is to ensure each student feels welcomed, included, and leaves with a foundational understanding of forró.

---

### **1. The Broader Goal**

- Understand that newcomers might feel self-conscious. A welcoming and friendly attitude is paramount.
- This is their first interaction with the group; their experience will determine future involvement.
- Prioritize making them feel welcomed and included.
- Aim to teach them enough so they feel accomplished and eager to return.

### **2. Introduction to Forró and Social Dancing**

- Briefly describe Forró and its origins.
- Share about the group's nature: a non-professional, community-focused gathering aimed at friends teaching one another.

### **3. Initiate with the 123 Count Marching**

- Stress the rhythm and the concept of weight transfer. (Note: Define "weight transfer" in multiple ways for clarity.)
- Over-emphasize the "marching" to accentuate weight transfer.
- Verbally count the 123-pause rhythm to familiarize them.

### **4. Introduce the Base 1 Steps**

- Connect it to the marching movement but with slight variations in footwork.

> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Chant "forward and back, back and forward" as guidance.

- Dance in front of them for visual clarity, then observe if they can replicate independently.

### **5. Delve into the Concept of Leading/Following**

- Understand that this concept might be new for some.
- In basic terms: leaders suggest moves, followers execute.

> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Initially explain the traditional roles (men lead, women follow), but emphasize our group's flexibility regarding roles.

- Recommend newcomers to stick to one role initially to avoid confusion.

### **6. Introduce the Base 1 Hold**

- Emphasize the back arm's importance and correct its improper placement.
- Stagger feet for safety.
- Discuss proximity comfort and demonstrate varying distances.
- Distinguish between a "gripping closely" and a strong leading arm.
- Allow them to dance to half a song in base 1. Discuss partner swapping.
- Encourage spatial exploration.
- Transition by explaining the typical starting position in dances.

### **7. Introduce Base 2 Steps**

- Highlight its simplicity compared to Base 1.
- Ensure smaller and more comfortable step-taking.

### **8. Introduce the Base 2 Hold**

- Explain its purpose for open moves like spins.
- Caution against excessive arm swinging.
- Advocate for maintaining connection without thumb grips.
- Execute hand connection exercises.
- Switch partners occasionally for adaptability.

### **9. Transition from Base 1 to Base 2**

- Point out the specific moments for transitions.

> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Aid with counting and stopping cues.

- Breakdown simultaneous movements for clearer understanding.

### **10. Transition from Base 2 to Base 1**

- Emphasize the significance of the left foot (the "decision foot").
- Describe the intricacies of changing holds.

### **11. Basic Spin (If Time Permits)**

- Present this as an optional fun activity.
- Emphasize the partners' rotational dynamics in Forró.

### **12. Navigating Social Dancing as a Beginner**

- Reassure newcomers of the group's supportive nature.
- Share helpful tips for maintaining rhythm and flow.

> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Remind them that even simple steps constitute dancing and offer coping mechanisms for complex moves.

- Urge them to seek guidance whenever necessary.

### **13. Feedback Session**

Take a few minutes to gather feedback from students. This invaluable input can shape future training sessions and offers insights into the students' journey.
