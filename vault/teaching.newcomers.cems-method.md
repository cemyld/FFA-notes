## **Introduction**

This guide aims to provide instructors with an alternate style that can be an interesting way to initiate newcomers to forró. It is based on focusing initially on the embrace and weight-change concepts before introducing the basic steps.

---

### **1. Introduction to Forró and Social Dancing**

- Briefly describe Forró and its origins.
- Share about the group's nature: a non-professional, community-focused gathering aimed at friends teaching one another.
- Talk about how forró differs from other partner dances the newcomers might have some familiarity with such as salsa, bachata, zouk etc.
- Briefly mention fundamental concepts and terminologies such as connection, rhythm, musicality, the frame, embrace.

### **2. Connection through the embrace**

- Talk about the importance of connection in dance and mention few possible forms of connection to your partner such as the chest, arms, hip, thighs, feet and even visual connection.
- Instruct the students to pair up. For pairing up, let them know currently it doesn't matter what role they prefer since we will be switching and doing both roles.
- Once every student has a partner, instruct them to embrace their partner using whichever hold feels comfortable for them and experiment with swaying in place. Let them know that both partners can currently lead which side and the speed of their sways and let them observe how giving lead or taking lead works without verbal communication.

> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** The close embrace in forró should feel like giving a warm hug to your partner

### **3. Side-to-side step (Balanço)**

- Now that students are comfortable with the closed position and swaying together. Instruct them to also step, lifting their foot, while doing the swaying motion.
- Demonstrate how you can stylize the side-to-side step by collecting the feet together everytime that you are stepping.
- Lead a discussion regarding the weight change required to facilitate the stepping.
- Play a song and let students try to follow along with the song. Rotate partners to let other students try it out as well.

> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** Understanding the concept of weight change is crucial in all dances. Make sure to emphasize the different types of weight change where it can be 50% evenly distributed, 100% on one foot, 20-40% on one foot and so on. Ensure that students understand being able to lift one of your feet completely means that all of their weight is on the other foot.

### **3. Side-to-side step Continued(Balanço)**

- Once students are comfortable with the side-to-side step. Demonstrate a few variations of the move:
  - travelling during the move
  - rotating during the move
  - playing with the rhythm
  - doing fake-out steps
  - leading through shoulders first
  - leading through hips first
- Explain the traditional roles in forró of lead and follower and let each pair pick a lead and a follower to experiment with the variations.
- Let each couple switch the roles and try experimenting as well.
- Once students are comfortable, you can play few medium paced songs for them to try out.

> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** It's important to talk about the possible delay in communication between partners during a dance. Let the students know that if they are trying a specific move with their partner, it may take them time to realize what they are doing and follow along. Tell the students to not introduce too many different variations during a dance which might make it much harder for followers to understand what they are trying to do. Quality over quantity in terms of dance move patterns.

> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** For students who want a challenge, let them know that they can try timing specific variations of the moves to the phrases in the music. Using same patterns for the same phrases in the songs greatly helps with musicality and makes it easier for follower to anticipate what's coming.
