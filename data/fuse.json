Maintaining a Positive Atmosphere**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Foster a friendly and respectful environment to ensure everyone's positive experience.\n- Exercise assertiveness to uphold order while preserving a relaxed and casual tone.\n- Always start by introducing yourself.\n- Keep the session aligned with the scheduled time without compromising your natural teaching style.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Class Organization**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Pre-plan your session to incorporate ample practice time. Encourage continuous practice even during pauses.\n- Leverage videos for move inspirations, particularly for advanced dancers.\n- Designate names for unnamed moves, serving as easy reference points.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Teaching Progression**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Refrain from overwhelming with details. Prioritize 1-2 key points at a time. Sometimes, letting students experiment aids learning.\n- Personalize advice while rotating among students.\n- Begin with universally known content, creating a familiar foundation.\n- Cater to varying pace: Introduce additional content for quick learners while ensuring slower students aren't left behind.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Time Management**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Encourage continuous practice and allocate dedicated practice intervals.\n\n---\n\n### **5. Adaptability and Flexibility**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Avoid rigid objectives. Instead, have a scalable plan with incrementally challenging milestones.\n- Introduce challenges progressively: Focus on refining techniques over content addition; experiment with tempo variations.\n- Engage in dance sessions with students (leading/following) to offer tailored feedback and assign 1-2 individual tasks.\n\n---\n\n### **6. Addressing Common Challenges**\n\n#### **Key Strategies:**\n\n- Adapt explanations when faced with comprehension gaps. Multiple perspectives often help.\n- For struggling individuals or late-comers: Identify their primary challenge, allocate a specific task, and celebrate their progress. Encourage peer teaching.\n- Counterbalance lead/follow discrepancies: Prepare role-specific content, motivate role-reversal, or reallocate volunteers.\n- If someone really wants to be in a different level than they should be: [Needs Solution]\n- There’s nothing that can *significantly* go wrong- roll with it, try your best; you can always openly communicate with the group, tell them it isn’t going to plan, laugh about it\n\n---\n","n":0.058}}},{"i":2,"$":{"0":{"v":"Newcomers","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nThis guide aims to provide instructors with a structured approach to introducing newcomers to their baby steps in forró! Our goal is to ensure each student feels welcomed, included, and leaves with a foundational understanding of this dance.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Broader Goal**\n\n- Understand that newcomers might feel self-conscious. A welcoming and friendly attitude is paramount.\n- This is their first interaction with the group; their experience will determine future involvement.\n- Prioritize making them feel welcomed and included.\n- Aim to teach them enough so they feel accomplished and eager to return.\n\n### **2. Introduction to Forró and Social Dancing**\n\n- Briefly describe Forró and its origins.\n- Share about the group's nature: a non-professional, community-focused gathering aimed at friends teaching one another.\n\n### **3. Initiate with the 123 Count Marching**\n\n- Stress the rhythm and the concept of weight transfer. (Note: Define \"weight transfer\" in multiple ways for clarity.)\n- Over-emphasize the \"marching\" to accentuate weight transfer.\n- Verbally count the 123-pause rhythm to familiarize them.\n\n### **4. Introduce the Base 1 Steps**\n\n- Connect it to the marching movement but with slight variations in footwork.\n\n- Dance in front of them for visual clarity, then observe if they can replicate independently.\n\n> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Chant \"forward and back, back and forward\" as guidance.\n\n### **5. Delve into the Concept of Leading/Following**\n\n- Understand that this concept might be new for some.\n- In basic terms: leaders suggest moves, followers execute.\n\n- Recommend newcomers to stick to one role initially to avoid confusion.\n\n> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Initially explain the traditional roles (men lead, women follow), but emphasize our group's flexibility regarding roles.\n\n### **6. Introduce the Base 1 Hold**\n\n- Emphasize the back arm's importance and correct its improper placement.\n- Stagger feet for safety.\n- Discuss proximity comfort and demonstrate varying distances.\n- Distinguish between a \"gripping closely\" and a strong leading arm.\n- Allow them to dance to half a song in base 1. Discuss partner swapping.\n- Encourage spatial exploration.\n- Transition by explaining the typical starting position in dances.\n\n### **7. Introduce Base 2 Steps**\n\n- Highlight its simplicity compared to Base 1.\n- Ensure smaller and more comfortable step-taking.\n\n### **8. Introduce the Base 2 Hold**\n\n- Explain its purpose for open moves like spins.\n- Caution against excessive arm swinging.\n- Advocate for maintaining connection without thumb grips.\n- Execute hand connection exercises.\n- Switch partners occasionally for adaptability.\n\n### **9. Transition from Base 1 to Base 2**\n\n- Point out the specific moments for transitions.\n\n- Breakdown simultaneous movements for clearer understanding.\n\n> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Aid with counting and stopping cues.\n\n### **10. Transition from Base 2 to Base 1**\n\n- Emphasize the significance of the left foot (the \"decision foot\").\n- Describe the intricacies of changing holds.\n\n### **11. Basic Spin (If Time Permits)**\n\n- Present this as an optional fun activity.\n- Emphasize the partners' rotational dynamics in Forró.\n\n### **12. Navigating Social Dancing as a Beginner**\n\n- Reassure newcomers of the group's supportive nature.\n- Share helpful tips for maintaining rhythm and flow.\n\n- Urge them to seek guidance whenever necessary.\n\n> 💡 **Clara's Tip:** Remind them that even simple steps constitute dancing and offer coping mechanisms for complex moves.\n\n### **13. Feedback Session**\n\nTake a few minutes to gather feedback from students. This invaluable input can shape future training sessions and offers insights into the students' journey.\n","n":0.044}}},{"i":3,"$":{"0":{"v":"Cem's Method Of Newcomer Teaching","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"## **Introduction**\n\nThis guide aims to provide instructors with an alternate style that can be an interesting way to initiate newcomers to forró. It is based on focusing initially on the embrace and weight-change concepts before introducing the basic steps.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Introduction to Forró and Social Dancing**\n\n- Briefly describe Forró and its origins.\n- Share about the group's nature: a non-professional, community-focused gathering aimed at friends teaching one another.\n- Talk about how forró differs from other partner dances the newcomers might have some familiarity with such as salsa, bachata, zouk etc.\n- Briefly mention fundamental concepts and terminologies such as connection, rhythm, musicality, the frame, embrace.\n\n### **2. Connection through the embrace**\n\n- Talk about the importance of connection in dance and mention few possible forms of connection to your partner such as the chest, arms, hip, thighs, feet and even visual connection.\n- Instruct the students to pair up. For pairing up, let them know currently it doesn't matter what role they prefer since we will be switching and doing both roles.\n- Once every student has a partner, instruct them to embrace their partner using whichever hold feels comfortable for them and experiment with swaying in place. Let them know that both partners can currently lead which side and the speed of their sways and let them observe how giving lead or taking lead works without verbal communication.\n\n> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** The close embrace in forró should feel like giving a warm hug to your partner\n\n### **3. Side-to-side step (Balanço)**\n\n- Now that students are comfortable with the closed position and swaying together. Instruct them to also step, lifting their foot, while doing the swaying motion.\n- Demonstrate how you can stylize the side-to-side step by collecting the feet together everytime that you are stepping.\n- Lead a discussion regarding the weight change required to facilitate the stepping.\n- Play a song and let students try to follow along with the song. Rotate partners to let other students try it out as well.\n\n> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** Understanding the concept of weight change is crucial in all dances. Make sure to emphasize the different types of weight change where it can be 50% evenly distributed, 100% on one foot, 20-40% on one foot and so on. Ensure that students understand being able to lift one of your feet completely means that all of their weight is on the other foot.\n\n### **3. Side-to-side step Continued(Balanço)**\n\n- Once students are comfortable with the side-to-side step. Demonstrate a few variations of the move:\n  - travelling during the move\n  - rotating during the move\n  - playing with the rhythm\n  - doing fake-out steps\n  - leading through shoulders first\n  - leading through hips first\n- Explain the traditional roles in forró of lead and follower and let each pair pick a lead and a follower to experiment with the variations.\n- Let each couple switch the roles and try experimenting as well.\n- Once students are comfortable, you can play few medium paced songs for them to try out.\n\n> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** It's important to talk about the possible delay in communication between partners during a dance. Let the students know that if they are trying a specific move with their partner, it may take them time to realize what they are doing and follow along. Tell the students to not introduce too many different variations during a dance which might make it much harder for followers to understand what they are trying to do. Quality over quantity in terms of dance move patterns.\n\n> 💡 **Cem's Tip:** For students who want a challenge, let them know that they can try timing specific variations of the moves to the phrases in the music. Using same patterns for the same phrases in the songs greatly helps with musicality and makes it easier for follower to anticipate what's coming.\n","n":0.04}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Intermediate","n":1}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Beginners","n":1}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Advanced","n":1}}}]}
